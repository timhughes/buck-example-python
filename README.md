# buck-example-python

## Pros:
- Good plugin for PyCharm


## Cons:
- Doesn't appear to work with pytest
- Buck executable is 100MB - not a big issue
- Depends on watchman
- Watchman binaries don't work on linux for 6 months (can be compiled from source). https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/760  
- buckbuild.slack.com only open to select few email domains. Lack of community
- requires a daemon running in the background
